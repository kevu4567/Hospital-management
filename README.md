**Hospital Vaccination Database System**

**Project Overview**

This project is a collaborative effort that resulted in the creation of a two-tier database system and front-end application for UIH (Universal Immunization Hub). By leveraging React in the backend and Vite in the frontend, our team has provided a solution that simplifies administrative tasks, enhances patient experience, and ensures the real-time tracking of vaccines. This system allows for easy patient registration, appointment scheduling, and record updates, all while streamlining the management of vaccination schedules by nurses.

**Features**
Two-Tier Database System: A robust backend architecture to handle complex data management tasks.
React & Vite Integration: Utilizes React for backend operations and Vite for a fast, modern frontend experience.
State Management: Implemented with the React Context API, ensuring efficient data flow across the application.
Seamless Navigation: Leveraging Vue Router for smooth page transitions and effective API interactions.
User-Friendly Interface: Prioritizes patient experience with intuitive registration, scheduling, and record management functionalities.

**Learning Outcomes**
Full-Stack Development: Gain insights into developing a full-stack application using React and Vite, covering both frontend and backend aspects.
State Management: Learn how to efficiently manage application state using the React Context API, a crucial skill for complex applications.
Routing and API Interaction: Understand the implementation of Vue Router for navigating between pages and interacting with APIs seamlessly.
Team Collaboration: Experience the dynamics of working in a team, from planning to implementation, and the importance of clear communication and collaboration.
This project not only showcases a practical application of combining various technologies to solve real-world problems but also serves as a valuable learning resource for those interested in the intricacies of full-stack development and the effective management of application state and routing.
